# Changelog

`ncc-registry` — a self-hosted registry node: one binary plus an embeddable Go library.

Formatted after [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), versioned with
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). "How to use it" is in [`README.md`](README.md);
**this file only answers what changed between releases**.

> This repository used to live inside [`ncc`](https://github.com/fusedmodel/ncc), in the
> `ncc-registry/` directory, sharing one changelog with the CLI. After becoming its own repository it
> **runs its own version line starting at `0.1.0`** — so `0.1.0` records *everything that already
> existed at the moment of the split*, not new features.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed · the `hur` kind label now follows the pinned HUR definition

`HUR` = **Harness-Use Runtime** — that is the **runtime** (defined as the runtime that supports a
harness in LLM calls, tool orchestration, context management, multi-provider access and run
evaluation); an entry with `kind=hur` is the **package it consumes**. The label therefore no longer
calls HUR itself a "package spec", and both sides now return exactly the same string — the literal
value is:

`Harness-Use Runtime 官方包（kind=agent 的包就是一个 Agent）`

(The definition is pinned in the NCC project's design docs.)

### Added · HUR artifacts: upload validation and signature attachment

- **`PUT /api/registry/<ref>/signature`** (requires `registry:publish`): attach or replace the
  signature of an **already published** `kind=hur` artifact. It accepts only the `signature` object,
  never the whole manifest — the artifact bytes have not changed, and accepting a manifest would mean
  letting a caller quietly rewrite the permission surface and the artifact digest, which is
  "swapping the package", not "signing it".
- **Ingest validation (`httpapi/hursign.go`)**: `kind=hur` must now be **self-describing**
  (`manifest.hur` carrying `spec` / `id` / `artifact.sha256`), with two cross-checks:
  - uploaded bytes' `sha256` ≠ `manifest.hur.artifact.sha256` → `digest_mismatch`;
  - `signature.sha256` ≠ the artifact digest → `signature_mismatch`;
  - a missing `keynum`, something that is not Minisign, or a `url` without `sigSha256` → `bad_signature`.
- **Deliberately not done**: no cryptographic verification (that needs the full Minisign machinery and
  a trusted key list, and belongs to the downloader), and **no signing with this node's own key** —
  "who signed it" must be decided by the publisher's own device.
- **Replicas are read-only**: a replica replicated to this node cannot be signed locally
  (`replica_readonly`); signing goes through the origin node.
- The console marks `kind=hur` entries that carry a signature with a "signed (keynum…)" badge (only
  local entries have a manifest; remote entries reported by workers do not, so the badge is absent
  rather than meaning "unsigned").

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-24

First standalone release: the repository was split out of `ncc`
(`module github.com/fusedmodel/ncc-registry`), publishing both a binary and a `go get`-able library.

### Changed · split into an independent repository and library

- **Module path**: `github.com/fusedmodel/ncc/ncc-registry` → `github.com/fusedmodel/ncc-registry`.
  Under the old path every package lived under `internal/`, so **not a single package could be
  imported from outside the module** — as a library it had never been usable.
- **Five packages were promoted to the top level** as public API: `config` · `model` · `storage` ·
  `store` · `httpapi`; `p2p` and `secretbox` stay in `internal/` (`httpapi` still imports them, which
  is legal inside the module and keeps them out of reach from outside).
- **Added `httpapi.NewServer` and `(*Server).Close`**: `NewRouter` returned only the routes, so the
  background loops it started (worker heartbeat / master sweeping expired workers / the
  hole-punchable entry point) had no way to stop. That is fine for a process that is exiting, but
  creating it repeatedly leaks goroutines. `NewRouter` keeps its signature and delegates to
  `NewServer` internally.
- The repository brought its own CI (gofmt / vet / build / smoke) and Release (binaries for six
  platforms + `checksums.txt` + a GHCR image).

### Fixed · the binary entry point `cmd/ncc-registry` never existed

`README.md`, `deploy/Dockerfile` and `scripts/smoke.sh` all said `go build ./cmd/ncc-registry`, but
**that directory had never been committed** (the initial commit was 22 files, all under `internal/`).
The documented build command had therefore always been broken and the binary could not be built at
all. `cmd/ncc-registry/main.go` now exists (`config.Load` → `store.Open` → `storage.NewLocal` →
`httpapi.NewServer`, with graceful shutdown).

### Fixed · artifact URLs contained backslashes on Windows (`storage.Local`)

`safeName` cleaned object names with `filepath.Clean`, but object names are **slash-separated**
identifiers (they go into URLs and travel verbatim between master and worker). On Windows
`filepath.Clean("/a")` yields `\a`, and `TrimPrefix(clean, "/")` could not strip that backslash, so
`PublicURL` produced an invalid address such as `…/blobs/\a`; putting it in a JSON request body
turned into a 400. Cleaning now uses `path` (slash semantics) and only converts with
`filepath.FromSlash` when writing to disk. Object names containing `\` or `:` are rejected as well.
**Behaviour on macOS / Linux is unchanged.**

### Fixed · three path assertions in the smoke script on Windows

`scripts/smoke.sh` took Git-Bash paths (`/tmp/xxx`) from `NCCR_*` and compared them against the
Windows absolute paths (`C:\Users\…`) echoed by the API, which can never match. That is a
path-display difference in the script, not in the behaviour under test; CI runs on ubuntu and is
unaffected. The suite currently has **167 checks**.

### Capability · artifact hosting and multi-node

- Accounts / namespaces / publish / search / download / replication; `sha256` verification and a
  stable `@namespace/slug` reference.
- **master / worker**: the master is authoritative (accounts, artifacts, node directory); a worker is
  an edge hosting point that hosts artifacts and nodes itself and periodically reports its directory.
  Clients only need one address — the directory they read is aggregated, and on download the master
  proxies the bytes back from whoever holds them.
- **Cluster writes**: **replicate** entries to workers and **revoke** the replicas when removing them.
- Three storage locations can be pointed at separately: `NCCR_DATA_DIR` / `NCCR_BLOB_DIR` /
  `NCCR_DB_PATH` (the common private-deployment request: bytes on NAS, database on local SSD).

### Capability · hosted nodes and agent discovery

- Users **register + heartbeat** the agents and services on their network, declaring *who I am, where
  I am, what I can do*.
- Nodes inside one trust domain discover each other, keep a connection list and aggregate by region;
  `/api/nodes/route` answers "which node should serve this capability".

### Capability · onboarding and authorization (connected ≠ authorized)

- One short link (or key + secret) adds an agent, and what it redeems is a **least-privilege node
  token**.
- Private artifacts / private nodes / non-public config require an explicit `grant`, and revocation
  takes effect immediately (optionally namespace-scoped).

### Capability · configuration hosting

- Team network / infrastructure / agent configuration as a first-class resource: revision history,
  rollback, and per-environment bundle fetch.
- 10 kinds, 7 formats, a 128 KB limit per entry; configs with `secret=true` are **encrypted at rest**
  (AES-256-GCM, key derived from this node's `jwt-secret`, ciphertext prefixed `enc:v1:`) — backing up
  only the database is safe; conversely, moving machines or losing the data directory means those
  values can no longer be decrypted (intentional, not a defect).

### Capability · share links and node governance

- **Sharing**: turn an artifact into a temporary download address, with no account and no CLI needed
  on the receiving end; limited in uses and time, revocable.
- **Governance (admin)**: the first account registered on this node automatically becomes an admin,
  and a machine credential `AK-…` is issued at the same time; it manages users / nodes / services
  (disable, enable, reset passwords, remove, archive), and every action is audited.

### Capability · node-side P2P (hole-punching decision surface)

- `GET /api/p2p/self`: produce a NAT profile and a conclusion on **this machine**;
  `POST /api/p2p/check`: perform a **real probe** (0 bytes, no business data) against a known mapped
  address; `GET|POST /api/p2p/serve`: open an entry point that answers STUN Binding requests only
  (**off** by default; `NCCR_P2P_SERVE=1` starts it with the service).
- **Measured conclusion**: a purely passive responder receives nothing on an
  `address_and_port_dependent` NAT — the hole must be opened by sending first, so the entry point
  performs **reverse punching** by default (one Binding request to the peer every 300 ms).
- The byte layer (the actual transfer) is not connected yet.
